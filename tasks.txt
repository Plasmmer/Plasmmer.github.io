"Floflis Platform is a apps' platform for the web or can work as a app itself (like PortableApps Platform is a app to run apps - in this case HTML5Apps Platform), which can also come as a standalone OS (the case of UniOS, which is governed by both UNI and FLOF - 50%/50% - tokens). Floflis simply can work nearly anywhere" (link to HTML5Apps Platform, UniOS, UNI () and FLOF () sites)
